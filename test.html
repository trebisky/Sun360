<h3>Sun 3/60</h3>

This "project" began with an email from Dan Moisa.
He has done an amazing piece of work, building his own sun3/60 board
based on schematics for the sun3/60.  He needs to modify the code
in ROM, discovered my sun3/80 work, and contacted me.
His specific need is to bypass the keyboard diagnostics in the ROM,
presumably because the board he build doesn't have keyboard hardware.
We may find that other things need to be bypassed or modified.
