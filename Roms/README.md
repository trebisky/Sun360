Sun 3/60 project

May 11, 2025

This directory holds my collection of Rom images

1. boot_1810_01.BIN -- version 1.9 bootrom from Dan

The rest are from https://www.sun3arc.org/ROMs/3_60/eprom.phtml

1. sun3_60_v1.9.srec -- the binary in the archive is bogus
1. sun3_60_v3.0.1.bin -- version 3.0.1 (has cdrom support)

The S-record converter is from https://github.com/elmicro/srec2bin_py
I used it to do a binary conversion of the 1.9 S-record file and it
matched the file from Dan perfectly
